Project Description: CubeRunner - A Unity Game in Progress

CubeRunner is an exciting game developed on the Unity Engine using the C# programming language. In this thrilling game, players take control of a cube and navigate it across a challenging track using the WASD keys. The objective of the game is to avoid obstacles, collect coins, and utilize speed boosts strategically.

One of the unique aspects of CubeRunner is the dynamic cube face changes. When the player presses a specific movement key, the cube's face changes to match the direction in which the cube is moving. This visually immersive feature adds depth to the gameplay experience, enhancing the player's connection with the cube character.

To bring the game to life, I personally designed and created the cube faces, giving them a distinct visual identity. These custom cube faces were then imported into the game, contributing to its overall aesthetic appeal and adding a personal touch to the project.

As of now, CubeRunner is an ongoing project, continuously evolving with new features and enhancements. While the core gameplay mechanics are in place, there are exciting plans for further development. Future iterations of the game will introduce additional features such as a shop system, skins for customizing the cube's appearance, various menus, and multiple levels with increasing difficulty. These upcoming features aim to provide players with an engaging and immersive gaming experience.

Throughout the development process of CubeRunner, I have gained valuable experience in using the Unity Engine and implementing game mechanics in C#. I have honed my skills in game design, asset creation, and integration, as well as scripting player controls and object interactions. This project showcases my ability to create captivating gameplay experiences and demonstrates my passion for game development.

Stay tuned for updates on CubeRunner as it progresses towards its full potential. With the inclusion of additional features and enhancements, CubeRunner aims to captivate players with its challenging gameplay, visually appealing graphics, and a wide range of customization options.
